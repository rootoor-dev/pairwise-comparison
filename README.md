# Details
A **`pairwise comparison`** is a method used to compare two items or alternatives against each other in order to determine their relative preference, importance, or superiority. This method is commonly used in decision-making processes, ranking systems, and preference assessments across various fields including psychology, economics, sports, and machine learning.

In a pairwise comparison, each item or alternative is compared systematically with every other item or alternative in the set. The comparisons are typically expressed as judgments or ratings indicating which of the two items is preferred, considered more important, or judged to be better according to certain criteria.

For example, in a simple pairwise comparison scenario where you have three items A, B, and C, you would compare:

1. A vs. B
2. A vs. C
3. B vs. C

After making these comparisons, you can then aggregate the results to rank the items based on the number of times each item is preferred or judged superior.

Pairwise comparisons can be conducted using various methods such as:

1. **Direct comparison**: Individuals directly compare two items and indicate their preference or judgment.

2. **Ranking**: Participants rank items in order of preference without directly comparing each pair.

3. **Rating scales**: Participants rate each item on a scale indicating their preference or judgment independently.

Pairwise comparisons are particularly useful when dealing with complex decision-making situations involving multiple criteria or attributes where it's impractical to evaluate all items simultaneously. They provide a structured approach to eliciting preferences and making informed decisions based on relative comparisons between alternatives.
